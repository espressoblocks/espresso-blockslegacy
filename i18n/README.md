# Translation Scripts
**NOTE: PenguinMod uses different scripts as we have a different method for translation.**

These are written for converting the Blockly format to Google Sheets & back.
The Scratch scripts are still used at build time, so we don't remove them.

Run these files with a file path as the argument if needed.

Example: `C:/scratch-blocks/i18n> node create_base_xlsx.js ./my_js_file.js`

# How to use
Read the comments inside `msg/messages.js` for instructions on importing & exporting translations
